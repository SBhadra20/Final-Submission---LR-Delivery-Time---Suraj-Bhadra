# Final-Submission---LR-Delivery-Time---Suraj-Bhadra

### Summary

Developed a predictive model to estimate food delivery time using Linear Regression.

Used historical order data with features like distance, order size, market conditions, and time-based factors.

Applied data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, outlier removal, and feature scaling.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and relationships.

Implemented Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for selecting the most relevant features.

Built and evaluated the model using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² score.

Conducted residual analysis to check model assumptions and diagnose performance.

Demonstrates how linear regression can solve real-world delivery time prediction problems effectively.
